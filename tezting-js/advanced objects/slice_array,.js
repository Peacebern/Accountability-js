arr = ["jason", "I", "does", "sability", "aryaStarr"];

console.log(arr.slice(1, 3)); //Note the syntax is slightly different from splice this does not necessary deltete elements , instead it copies as instructed particular elements of an array into a new array without including the end as shown below, syntax is arr.slice(start, end); 

//"I", "does" is what it prints
